# Geo-Paint
This is an Android app that uses the device's physical location as input for a simple drawing program. By caring the device around a space, the user will be able to draw pictures based by "tracing" their movement. In effect, users will carry around a virtual "pen" (similar to that used in Turtle graphics, producing a drawing visible on a map. Users will also be able to share these drawings, so that others can see their artwork.
